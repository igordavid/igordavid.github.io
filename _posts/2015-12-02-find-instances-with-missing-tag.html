<p>Sometimes you want to find out if instances are not tagged with some Tag key, for example if you are grouping your instances with tag "Project" or similar.</p>
<p>You can use the following script for that which will send SNS notification and also e-mail with all instances which doesn't have particular tag, showing you how many instances are running in total.</p>
<p>Change SNS topic to your one and also e-mail source and recipients.</p>
<p>Script can be downloaded from <a title="Official Cloudhowto Github" href="https://github.com/cloudhowto/python/blob/master/print_missing_tags.py" target="_blank">official Cloudhowto GitHub repository</a>.</p>
