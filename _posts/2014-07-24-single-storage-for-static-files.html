<p>It is best practice to have fault-tolerant and robust storage for your static web files, such as images or css files. Ideal product for those services is <a href="http://aws.amazon.com/s3" title="AWS S3" target="_blank">AWS S3</a></p>
<p>It can be done in multiple ways, for example by syncing your file system to S3.</p>
<p>Another way is to solve this on application level, so your application will copy files to S3 and modify links to use S3 path instead of local storage.</p>
<p>If you are using Wordpress, here is a great plugin called <a href="https://github.com/deliciousbrains/wp-amazon-web-services" title="AWS" target="_blank">AWS for Wordpress</a></p>
<p>After you install it, you can install <a href="http://wordpress.org/plugins/amazon-s3-and-cloudfront/" title="Amazon S3 and CloudFront" target="_blank">Amazon S3 and Cloudfront</a> plugin.</p>
<p>The installation is quite straightforward and once you submit your credentials (Public/Secret key), you can create new S3 buckets or use existing ones.</p>
<p>After this, all new media files will be automatically stored into your S3 bucket and Wordpress will start using S3 for source of media files.</p>
