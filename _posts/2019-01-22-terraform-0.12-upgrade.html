As we all are eagearly waiting for Terraform 0.12 official release, there might be few issues
when trying now to update to that version from previous one.
<br>
If you are getting errors such as:
<br>
"Error: Unsupported block type
Error: Missing newline after argument"
<br>
<br>
.. I would suggest that you run "$terraform fmt" with previous TF version (e.g. 0.10.7)
<br>
That should fix syntax for TF 0.12
<br>
<br>
If you are getting error:
<br>
"The variable name "count" is reserved due to its special meaning inside module
blocks."
<br>
... I would suggest that you rename "count" variable as it's now reserved word.
<br>
<br>
If you are getting error:
<br>
"Error: Failed to download module"
<br>
... I would suggest you check if you have added "./dir_name" into your module path.
