<p>If you want to have solution which is reliable, enterprise-class, professional and supported, one of the best tools to use is <a title="CPM (Cloud Protection Manager)" href="http://www.n2ws.com/" target="_blank">CPM</a>.</p>
<p>It is not free, in matter of facts it is not cheap at all, however it is doing very good job! There is 30-days trial version so you can have a feeling of the product and see if it fits your needs. It will give you nice GUI, where you can create different users, policies, schedules, etc. Recovery options is very good since it preserves tags, instance details (VPC, subnet, etc) and will allow recovery from last AMI or from last snapshot, which is very handy as it will allow you to create last know state of your machine.</p>
<p>There are also nice features for using additional backup scripts ("application consistent") which means that recovery will be performed in nice way for application, without harming some crucial files (such as transaction logs for database)</p>
<p>Some of the features:</p>
<p><strong>Flexible Backup Policies &amp; Schedules, Disaster Recovery (DR), Rapid &amp; Flexible Recovery, Application Support, Automatic Retention</strong></p>
<p>Their Support is also very responsive and nice.</p>
