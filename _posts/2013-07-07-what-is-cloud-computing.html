<p>Greetings!</p>
<p>As you all (probably) know, the era of Cloud has begun! Somebody is comparing it with big invents such as new Pentium processors, color graphics cards, the invention of WWW... Consider it anyway you want, the Cloud technology is something which is becoming a major buzz word.</p>
<p>What is Cloud computing?</p>
<p>The term "cloud computing" refers to the <strong><em>on-demand delivery of IT resources via the Internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.</em></strong></p>
<p>Here are the key points why anyone should use Cloud computing:</p>
<p>- <strong>No Upfront Investment:</strong> Replace upfront infrastructure investment with low monthly costs</p>
<p>- <strong>Low Ongoing Cost:</strong> Reduce your overall IT costs</p>
<p>- <strong>Flexible Capacity:</strong> Eliminate guessing on your infrastructure capacity needs</p>
<p>- <strong>Speed &amp; Agility:</strong> Develop and deploy applications faster</p>
<p>- <strong>Apps not Ops:</strong> Focus on projects that differentiate your business, not the infrastructure</p>
<p>- <strong>Global Reach:</strong> Take your apps global in minutes</p>
<p>Main leader in Cloud computing nowadays is <a href="http://aws.amazon.com" title="Amazon Web services" target="_blank"> Amazon Web services</a> or simple AWS</p>
